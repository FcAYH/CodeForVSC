                           The humanities in Our Life
 What is humanities? We often call subjects like history, philosophy, literature and so on hunanities.  
That's ture, but I don't think humanities should be simply understanded as a subject. In my opinion, 
no matter where we go, hunanities will accompany us.
  Sometimes we say that Emotional intelligence is more important than Intelligence quotient. It's not
totally suitable to say that studying Science and engineering discipline will enhance our Intelligence
quotient and learning hunanities helps to improve our Emotional intelligence. But they do have this trend.
When we read books about science,we can see an army of formula theorems which are full of logic. If you 
are a novice without a teacher, you can be very difficult to get the key of the theorems. At the same time,
hunanities books are friendly, we can be absorbed in learning hunanities easily.
  In views of the difference in learing the two kinds of discipline.I don't think it's a wrong decision to
choose a Science and engineering discipline to study in the college, meanwhile, choosing to learn hunanities
is well, too. However, we shouldn't let learn science be the sole target.Only by studying hunanities while 
focusing on the study of science will be more conducive to our success.
