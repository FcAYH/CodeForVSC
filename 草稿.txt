On How to Learn English as a Second Language
    I always thought about why I have Learned English for nearly nine years,but my English standerd now is surely
worse than my Chinese standerd when I was nine.When I was a baby,my parents spent an army of time accompanying me.They
repeated a word for my times until I could say it slowly.As time going on,I learned to say many words,and I can talk
with other people easily.
    So I think studying English is similer to studying Chinese.We should use the way we learn our mother language to
learn the second language.
    The most basic thing we need to do is spending enough time on Engilsh.Because we are in China,so most of the people
around us speak Chinese,which means we are learning Chinese inadvertently.Then we should try our best to make an English 
speaking environment.We can listen to English news,sing English songs,watch Engilsh movies.If conditions premit,we can
try to communicate with English speakers.Think about how we approach Chinese,we can do the same way to approach Engilsh.
    Generally speaking,it can be hard to do all the things above.The difficult to find a native Engilsh speaker who 
is willing to talk with you is obviously huge.Besides,when we listen to Chinese news,if we hear a strange character,
we often search it on the internet,but if it is English,at more cases,we won't.Maybe it is because there are so many 
new words,maybe it is caused by the strangeness to English that we can't look up new words at the same time listening
to ne news.All of these things are killing our will,perhaps some people will give up after encountering so much 
trouble.So we need perseverance as well.No matter how difficult it is,we should not retreat.Only stick to studying 
can we success in the end.
